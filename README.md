# BurgersNbbq
Fictional Smokehouse restaurant to entice the customer in to see what authentic smokehouse meat and dishes they are cooking up.

The project had a heavy focus on learning a CSS processor in SCSS and using CSS animations to produce smoother transitions and an overall better appearance. The use of CSS helps me create a menu module for people to view without leaving the page whilst using something similar for the hamburger menu which draws more focus on that component.

The use of javascript validation was used in the booking section as it needed more control on the inputs that the restaurant would need, all valid input fields would be highlighted in green else red would be shown if incompleted.

SASS has helped me understand a better process of structuring and laying out code but understanding BEM to help solve future coding solutions will help out with planning projects.
